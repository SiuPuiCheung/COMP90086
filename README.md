# COMP90086 - Computer Vision
This repository contains assignments for the COMP90086 Computer Vision course, 2022 Semester 2, offered by The University of Melbourne, School of Computing and Information Systems.

## Assignments Overview

### Assignment 1 - [COMP90086_asst1_2022-checkpoint.ipynb]
*Assignment 1 primarily serves as an introduction to computer vision concepts with a focus on mapping between world and image coordinates and thinking with filters. The assignment includes both theoretical and optional practical components.*

### Assignment 2 - [COMP90086_asst2_202.ipynb]
*In Assignment 2, the focus is on implementing and evaluating Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification. It includes tasks such as implementing a specified CNN architecture, performing error analysis, and visualizing the feature space used for image classification.*

### Assignment 3 - [COMP90086_asst3_2022.ipynb]
*Assignment 3 explores advanced computer vision techniques, including computing the Fundamental Matrix using the 8-point algorithm and working with image correspondences and epipolar geometry. The assignment combines both theoretical understanding and practical implementation.*
